# vimux

This repo is for storing the vim and tmux related configs.
Just tweak the variable `HERE` variable in the shell script
and go to the home folder to run

'''sh 
sh vimux/install.sh
'''

to generate soft links.
To remove them run

'''sh
sh vimux/uninstall.sh
'''

The `.term` folder is for navigation instructions for tmux shortcuts.
Hope things make sense.
