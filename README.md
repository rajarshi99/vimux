# vimux

This repo is for storing the neovim, vim  and tmux related configs.
Just tweak the variable `HERE` variable in the shell script
and go to the home folder to run

```sh
sh vimux/install.sh
```

to generate soft links.
To remove them run

```sh
sh vimux/uninstall.sh
```

The `.term` folder is for navigation instructions for tmux shortcuts.
Hope things make sense.
